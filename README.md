# mat-edge-axes

Matlab tools to display rich information on the edges of a plot, inspired by Edward Tufte's range frames, dot dash plots and rug plots.

Matlab's capabilities to display information on the edges of a plot are limited to ticks and labels. Tufte suggests one should use the edges of the plot wisely to display rich information, for example: marginal distributions, rug plots, dot dash plots etc. These are all beyond Matlab's usual capabilities.

edgeaxes.m solves this problem by setting up a completely new axes object besides the main axes object. The new axes object has a convenient coordinate system. The x-coordinate of the newly created axes is linked to the coordinate system of the original axes object, so that you can use it for example:

- display custom tick marks and labels, for example rug plots
- display custom range frames or marginal distributions
- use it to make a second plot that is guaranteed to share one axis with the original plot. Useful for packing several plots side by side for e.g. small multiples or just to save space.
- use it display two different scales for tick marks, e.g. inches and centimeters.

Installation
============

After downloading, you should add edgeaxes.m to your matlab path. For example:

    addpath('/path/to/mat-edge-axes/')
    
Note that edgeaxes.m is a standalone function and you don't necessarily need tick.m, label.m or autotick.m. However, these are very helpful in many practical situations and you might find it faster to use those functions than write your own.  

Usage

In the typical mode of operation, the newly create axes object shares x-axis with the main plot, and y-axis is pointing away from the main axes. In this new coordinate system, adding tick marks, range frames, marginal distributions etc. becomes a breeze. Some examples you can do with it:

Include outside and inside tick marks with different scales, for example inches and centimeters (source: [examples/example_multipleticks.m](examples/example_multipleticks.m))

Use dashes on the edge to visualize marginal distributions (Tufte calls this dot-dash plot) (source: [examples/example_dotdash.m](examples/example_dotdash.m))

The frame line extends to the minimum/maximum of data (source: [examples/example_rangeframe.m](examples/example_rangeframe.m))

Rug plots, which is a combination of several dot-dash plots. (source: [examples/example_rugplot.m](examples/example_rugplot.m))

For publication quality plots, working in centimeters or inches is recommended, and then using the fantastic export_fig (https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig) toolbox for exporting.
